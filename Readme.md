# Prefuse

Prefuse is a set of software tools for creating rich interactive data 
visualizations in the Java programming language. 
Prefuse supports a rich set of features for data modeling, visualization, 
and interaction. It provides optimized data structures for tables, graphs, 
and trees, a host of layout and visual encoding techniques, and support 
for animation, dynamic queries, integrated search, and database connectivity. 

Prefuse is written in Java, using the Java 2D graphics library, and is 
easily integrated into Java Swing applications or web applets.

Prefuse is a creation of the [UC Berkeley Visualization Lab] (http://vis.berkeley.edu/). 
For more information see (license-prefuse.txt) and (http://prefuse.org/). 

It was developed until 2007 by its original author, [Jeffrey Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/). 

Prefuse is licensed under the terms of a [BSD license](prefuse-core/license-prefuse.txt) and can be freely used for

This project is a fork which aims at providing easy maven access for several projects which depend on Prefuse.
